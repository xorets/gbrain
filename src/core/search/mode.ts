/**
 * v0.32.3 search-lite mode bundles.
 *
 * Three named modes that bundle the search-lite knobs from PR #897 into a
 * single config key so users pick once at install time and stop thinking
 * about it. Each mode resolves to a complete knob set; per-call SearchOpts
 * and per-key config overrides still win — mode just supplies the default.
 *
 * The resolution chain matches the v0.31.12 model-tier pattern at
 * `src/core/model-config.ts:resolveModel`:
 *   per-call opts → per-key config → MODE_BUNDLES[cfg.search.mode] → MODE_BUNDLES.balanced
 *
 * `resolveSearchMode` is called at the top of bare `hybridSearch`, NOT just
 * inside the `hybridSearchCached` wrapper. Eval commands (`eval replay`,
 * `eval longmemeval`) call bare hybridSearch and must test the same
 * mode-affected behavior as production. See `[CDX-5+6]` in the plan.
 *
 * `knobsHash` produces the SHA-256 the query cache uses to prevent
 * cross-mode contamination. The PR #897 cache keyed only on
 * (source_id, query_text) — a tokenmax run with expansion+limit=50 would
 * populate a row that a subsequent conservative call reads back. Migration
 * v56 adds `knobs_hash` column; lookup filters by knobs_hash equality AND
 * embedding similarity. See `[CDX-4]` in the plan.

 * field in hybrid.ts) instead of letting it load a second, independent one.
