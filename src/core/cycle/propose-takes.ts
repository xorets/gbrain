/**
 * v0.36.1.0 (T3) — propose_takes cycle phase.
 *
 * Scans markdown pages updated since last run, sends each page's prose to
 * a tuned LLM extractor, writes the extracted gradeable claims to the
 * `take_proposals` queue. User accepts/rejects via `gbrain takes propose`.
 *
 * Idempotency contract (D17 schema spec):
 *   The unique index on (source_id, page_slug, content_hash, prompt_version)
 *   means an unchanged page never re-spends LLM tokens. Bumping
 *   PROPOSE_TAKES_PROMPT_VERSION cleanly invalidates the cache so a tuned
 *   prompt re-runs proposals on every page.
 *
 * F2 fence dedup:
 *   The phase reads the page's existing `<!-- gbrain:takes:begin -->` fence
 *   (when present) and passes the canonical take rows to the extractor as
 *   "things you have already captured." This prevents duplicate proposals
 *   when a user adds prose to a page that already has takes.
 *
 * Auto-resolve posture:
 *   propose_takes only WRITES proposals to the queue. Nothing here mutates
 *   the canonical takes table. Operator opt-in via `gbrain takes propose
 *   --accept N` is the only path from queue to canonical fence (D17).
 *
 * Prompt tuning status (v0.36.1.0 ship state):
 *   The default extractor prompt was tuned against the synthetic corpus at
 *   test/fixtures/calibration/ and validated via the cat15 propose_takes
 *   eval in the gbrain-evals repo. First live run scored 0.952 F1 on
 *   training (target 0.85) and 0.922 F1 on holdout (target 0.80), with a
 *   0.03 train-holdout gap (no overfitting). PROPOSE_TAKES_PROMPT_VERSION
 *   is "v0.36.1.0-tuned-cat15". Re-tuning requires re-running cat15;
 *   bumping the version string invalidates the take_proposals idempotency
 *   cache so old proposals stay as audit history but the next cycle
 *   re-extracts fresh against the new prompt.
 *
 * The extractor LLM call is INJECTED via opts.extractor for tests, so the
 * phase can run hermetically in unit tests without touching the gateway.

 *   - kind enum kept narrow — three tags; the v1 stub's 4-tag enum bled
 *     into noise classification. #4736: the tags now use the fence
 *     vocabulary parseExtractorOutput accepts ('take'|'bet'|'hunch'); the

 *     still describe the extraction behavior. prediction/judgment stay
 *     mapped in the parser for cached/old-model outputs.

 * Replaces the v0.36.1.0-stub. If you re-tune, run cat15 against the

A "gradeable claim" is a prediction, recommendation, or interpretive judgment
that could turn out wrong over time. Examples:
- "X company will hit ARR milestone by Q3" (take: a prediction)
- "Y founder is going to struggle with execution" (take: a judgment)
- "Z market will compress in 18 months" (take: a prediction)
- "I bet alice wins the round" (bet)
- "Maybe DTC is quietly coming back" (hunch)

NOT gradeable (do NOT extract these):
- Pure facts ("X was founded in 2020")
- Direct quotes from others without endorsement
- Restatements of an earlier claim in the same page

For each gradeable claim, output a JSON object with:
- claim_text   (string, <=200 chars, paraphrase or near-verbatim from prose)
- kind         ('take' = prediction or interpretive judgment | 'bet' = explicit wager language | 'hunch' = low-conviction guess)
- holder       ('world' | 'people/<slug>' | 'companies/<slug>' | 'brain' — default 'brain' when author asserts the claim)
- weight       (number 0..1 inferred from hedging language: 'I bet'/'strong conviction'=0.7-0.85,
                'I think'/'moderate conviction'=0.5-0.7, 'maybe'/'I'd guess'=0.3-0.5)
- domain       (short tag — e.g. 'tactics', 'macro', 'hiring', 'geography', 'pricing')
