/**
 * date-grounding.ts — the time vocabulary and the relative-date rule shared by
 * every LLM extraction prompt.
 *
 * THREE TIMES. Every stored claim can carry three different times; code and
 * prompts must never conflate them:
 *
 *   observation time  when the source text was written or said (a chat turn's
 *                     timestamp, a dated note's filename or `date:`). Relative
 *                     phrases ("last week", "by Friday") resolve against it.
 *   event/validity    when the claim was true in the world (`facts.valid_from`;
 *     time            later, edge validity). May differ from observation time:
 *                     a 2026-03 note says "we closed the round in 2024".
 *   recording time    when GBrain stored it (`created_at`). Never used to
 *                     interpret text.
 *
 * WHY. "User went to Lisbon last week" is useless months later; the extractor
 * must write "the week of 2026-03-02". Keeping the relative phrase beside the
 * date ("two days ago (2026-03-02)") reads wrong once the fact is shown under
 * its event date: a reader applies "two days ago" a second time. Resolving against today's date
 * (the run date) silently re-dates historical imports, so the rule names the
 * observation date and forbids "today". When the observation date is unknown
 * the phrase is kept as written — never a guessed date.
 *
 * `resolveObservationDate` deliberately does NOT use a page's `event_date`
 * (an event's own time, not when the note was written) nor the `fallback`
 * effective-date source (row creation / update time), and never returns now.
 *
 * Pure: no engine, no IO. Shared API (other extraction work imports it).
