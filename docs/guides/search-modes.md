# Search Modes

Two decisions shape every gbrain lookup, and this guide covers both:

1. **Which mode bundle** your brain runs — `conservative` / `balanced` /
   `tokenmax`, the named cost-knob presets that control cache, token budget,
   core-library expansion defaults, and result count. This is the config-level decision you
   make once (at `gbrain init` or via `gbrain config set search.mode`).
2. **Which lookup verb** to use per call — `gbrain search` (keyword),
   `gbrain query` (hybrid), or `gbrain get` (direct). This is the
   per-lookup decision an agent makes on every question.

To see how a specific result was ranked, or why an expected page is missing,
see [Explaining search results](search-explain.md).

## The three mode bundles

A search mode is a named preset for retrieval knobs. Operation-level options
can override it, so the bundle alone does not describe provider calls.
The bundles are frozen in `src/core/search/mode.ts` (`MODE_BUNDLES`).

Semantic result caching is temporarily disabled in every mode, regardless of
configuration or per-call overrides. The cache settings below are retained
configuration values; each request performs fresh retrieval. Stored cache rows
and maintenance commands remain available.

| Knob                          | `conservative` | `balanced` | `tokenmax`     |
|-------------------------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| `cache.enabled`               | true           | true       | true           |
| `cache.similarity_threshold`  | 0.92           | 0.92       | 0.92           |
| `cache.ttl_seconds`           | 3600           | 3600       | 3600           |
| `intentWeighting`             | true           | true       | true           |
| `tokenBudget`                 | **4000**       | **12000**  | **off**        |
| `expansion` (LLM multi-query) | false          | false      | **true**       |
| `expansion_variant_budget`    | `null` (legacy) | `null` (legacy) | `null` (legacy) |
| `relationalRetrieval`         | false          | **true**   | **true**       |
| `relational_rerank_pin`       | 3              | 3          | 3              |
| `keyword_arm_confidence_floor` | `null` (off)  | `null` (off) | `null` (off)  |
| `metadata_boost_gate`         | `lexical`      | `lexical`  | `lexical`      |
| `hub_dampening`               | `off`          | `off`      | `off`          |
| `searchLimit` default         | 10             | 25         | 50             |
| `reranker` (cross-encoder)    | off            | `voyage:rerank-2.5` | `voyage:rerank-2.5` |
| `autocut` (rerank-cliff cut)  | off            | off        | off            |

The `expansion` row is not decisive for any shipped verb today: `gbrain query`
(the only verb that can expand) expands by default in every mode — pass
`--no-expand` / `expand: false` to opt out — while `gbrain search`, the memory
verbs and the eval harnesses pin expansion per call. The bundle value (and the
`search.expansion` config key) only reaches a core-library caller that leaves `expansion`
unset AND wires an `expandFn`; none ship today. `gbrain search modes` reports
the bundle value and prints the operation-level exception before its knob table.

This preserves the existing query contract: changing modes does not silently
enable or disable expansion. `query` defaults to `expand: true`; explicit
`expand: false` (CLI `--no-expand`) wins even in `tokenmax`. `search` never
expands, even with `search.expansion=true`. Keyless retrieval takes the
keyword-only path before expansion; configured embedding and expansion
providers are prerequisites. Image-only retrieval also skips expansion.
Check response metadata `expansion_applied` for actual variant use, not just
the requested setting. A configured cloud expander receives the query;
its model's input/output charges are separate from downstream reading costs.

- **`conservative`** — smallest payloads. Pairs naturally with a cheap
  downstream model (Haiku-class) or a high query volume.
- **`balanced`** — the default and the fallback when no mode is set.
- **`tokenmax`** — no token budget, 50 results by default.
  Pairs with an expensive downstream model you want fully fed.

Seven of the knobs deserve a sentence:

- **`expansion`** rewrites your query into multiple variants via a cheap
  LLM call when available (the historical Haiku estimate is roughly $1.50 per
  1K queries; actual charges depend on model and token counts). It can recover
  alternate phrasings but can also hurt precision. `gbrain query` requests
  expansion in every mode unless `--no-expand`;
  this knob does not turn it off (see the caption under the table).
- **`expansion_variant_budget`** (config key
  `search.expansion_variant_budget`) is the total RRF weight the expansion
  variants share at fusion time (`weight_i = b / n_voting_arms`; the original
  query's list always keeps weight 1). `null` — the default in every bundle —
  is the legacy equal-weight fusion, under which the LongMemEval receipt shows
  expansion halving small-k strict recall (93.19% → 54.89% `recall_all@5`); a
  number in (0, 4] caps the variants' total influence (`1.0` lets two agreeing
  variants exactly tie the original's top vote; `0.5` subordinates them). A
  no-op when `expansion` is off. Ranker-wave receipt (same recorded variants
  replayed at every budget): strict `recall_all@5` climbs monotonically as
  the budget shrinks — 255/470 legacy → 394/470 at 0.25 — but even 0.25
  trails plain hybrid (439/470) by 43 questions on the held-out decision set,
  so the bundles keep `null` and the knob is an operator lever. That receipt
  predates page-grain fusion and the relaxed-keyword demotion: on the current
  ranking (halfA430, 215 questions, frozen variants) legacy expansion scores
  205/215, budget `1.0` 203/215, `0.25` 202/215 and no expansion 202/215, so
  capping the variants no longer helps. **Say to your agent:**
  *"Cap how much query expansion can outvote my original query"* (no skill backs this; your agent
  runs `gbrain config set search.expansion_variant_budget <b>`, and
  `gbrain config set search.expansion_variant_budget legacy` restores the
  default).
- **`relationalRetrieval`** adds a graph-walk recall arm for relational
  questions ("who invested in X", "what connects A and B"). Common rewordings
  count too: "X's investors", "people who funded X", "who is the founder of
  X", "which companies has X backed", "relationship between A and B", "who
  can introduce me to X". It's a pure no-op for non-relational queries, and
  it only fires when the named entity resolves to a page in your brain. The `query` op's `relational` flag
  forces it on/off per call.
- **`relational_rerank_pin`** (config key `search.relational_rerank_pin`;
  3 in every bundle) keeps those graph-walk answers from being buried by the
  cross-encoder reranker: the reranker scores page TEXT, and an edge-derived
  answer's text need not mention the entity you asked about, so on the
  relational benchmark the reranker alone dropped hit@1 from 21/39 to 3/39.
  After the reranker runs, up to this many relational-arm rows are pinned back
  above the reranked text rows in their fused order; `0`/`off` restores the
  pre-pin ranking. A pure no-op for non-relational queries and whenever the
  reranker is off or failed open. It trusts the graph — if your edges are
  stale, an edge answer now sits at the top rather than at the end of page 1.
  **Say to your agent:** *"Stop pinning graph answers above the reranked
  results"* (no skill backs this; your agent runs
  `gbrain config set search.relational_rerank_pin off`, and
  `gbrain config set search.relational_rerank_pin 3` restores the default).
- **`metadata_boost_gate`** (config key `search.metadata_boost_gate`;
  `lexical` in every bundle) decides whether the post-fusion metadata boosts
  (backlinks, salience, recency, graph adjacency, alias resolution) run when
  the vector arm was the only voter. Those boosts reward well-connected hub
  pages; on paraphrase-style concept questions where no keyword, title or
  relational row fused, they promoted hubs over the page that actually
  matched. `lexical` skips them in that case and keeps the vector order;
  `always` restores the pre-wave pipeline. Supersession, exact-match and
  reranking are untouched either way. Receipt: conceptual-recall nDCG@5 rose
  from 53.0 to 57.8 on held-out concepts with the entity, brain and
  LongMemEval benchmarks byte-identical.
  **Say to your agent:** *"Always apply backlink and recency boosts, even on
  vector-only matches"* (no skill backs this; your agent runs
  `gbrain config set search.metadata_boost_gate always`, and
  `gbrain config set search.metadata_boost_gate lexical` restores the default).
- **`keyword_arm_confidence_floor`** (config key
  `search.keyword_arm_confidence_floor`; off in every bundle) down-weights the
  keyword and title arms in the fusion when the keyword arm's top-vs-second
  margin ratio is below the floor (only when a vector arm also voted and the
  query is not relational). It ships off: its pre-registered conceptual-recall test did
  not move the held-out score, and most of that gap came from pages the
  keyword arm never matched at all. Operators with a noisy keyword arm can set
  a floor in `(0, 1]`; `off` restores the default.
- **`keywordOrFallback`** (on in every mode; config key
  `search.keywordOrFallback`) relaxes the keyword and title arms from AND
  to OR when strict AND matching finds nothing, so a multi-word query still
  gets keyword recall instead of leaning on vectors alone. Set the config
  key to `false` to keep strict AND matching.

### Setting and resolving the mode

```bash
gbrain config set search.mode tokenmax
```

Per-knob resolution (highest first):

    per-call SearchOpts → per-key config override (search.cache.enabled, …) →
      MODE_BUNDLES[search.mode] → MODE_BUNDLES.balanced (fallback)

Mode resolution lives in bare `hybridSearch`, not just the cached wrapper,
so eval replays test the same mode-affected behavior as the production
`query` op. Result counts follow the per-call `limit`, or the mode's
`searchLimit` when no limit is supplied. The wrapper does not read or write
stored semantic results while caching is disabled. `gbrain search modes`
reports effective `cache_enabled: false`, and `cache stats` reports
`enabled: false`, even when retained configuration enables the cache.

### Cost intuition

The table estimates only the tokens your *downstream agent* pays to read
per query. Embedding, reranking and expansion calls can add separate charges. The
corner-to-corner spread is ~25x once you pair mode with downstream model.
Rough anchors at 10K queries/month, full payload, no cache savings:

| Mode \ Downstream | Haiku-class (\$1/M in) | Sonnet-class (\$3/M in) | Opus-class (\$5/M in) |
|---|---|---|---|
| conservative (~4K tok) | **\$40/mo** | \$120/mo | \$200/mo |
| balanced (~10K tok) | \$100/mo | \$300/mo | \$500/mo |
| tokenmax (~20K tok) | \$200/mo | \$600/mo | **\$1,000/mo** |

Scales linearly with volume. Budget for fresh retrieval on every query while
semantic result caching is disabled; repeated searches may take longer and use
more provider calls. Downstream prompt caching in the agent loop is independent.
Mismatched pairings waste capacity in both directions — a tokenmax payload overwhelms a cheap model,
a conservative payload starves an expensive one. The full methodology and
realistic-scale walkthrough live in
[`docs/eval/SEARCH_MODE_METHODOLOGY.md`](../eval/SEARCH_MODE_METHODOLOGY.md).

### CLI surfaces

```bash
gbrain search modes              # what is running, with per-knob attribution
gbrain search modes --reset      # clear search.* overrides (mode bundle wins)
gbrain search stats [--days N]   # cache hit rate, intent mix, budget drops
gbrain search tune [--apply]     # data-driven recommendations
gbrain search diagnose "<query>" --target <slug>
                                 # trace where a page surfaces (or fails to)
                                 # across the keyword/vector/alias/hybrid layers
```

`gbrain search modes` also answers the question the knob table cannot: is
the resolved reranker actually going to run? Below the attribution table it
prints one runtime line — `Reranker: voyage:rerank-2.5 (enabled) —
VOYAGE_API_KEY present`, `Reranker: off (resolved) — …`, or `Reranker:
<model> (enabled but NOT running) — <paste-ready fix>` — and each bundle row
carries `reranker=… topNIn=… autocut=…`. `--json` exposes the same verdict
as `reranker_readiness`. Without the key, search still works: results come
back in fusion order, `gbrain search "<query>" --explain` shows
`degraded: reranker_skipped (no_key)`, and `gbrain doctor`'s
`reranker_health` names the fix. **Say to your agent:** *"check whether my
brain's reranker is actually running"* — *"turn reranking off for now"* —
your agent runs `gbrain search modes` / `gbrain doctor`, then either exports
`VOYAGE_API_KEY` or runs `gbrain config set search.reranker.enabled false`.

TypeSafe's Jev can be the reranker instead of Voyage (`gbrain decide enable
rerank` sets it and `gbrain decide disable rerank` restores your previous
reranker; setup in [TypeSafe (Jev)](../ai-providers/typesafe.md)). The same
provider also powers System One, a set of off-by-default decision slots in
the search path, such as an evidence gate that drops results with no evidence
for the question but, by default, never below three results and never an exact match.
None of them changes a mode bundle. See [System One](system-one.md).

The mode picker runs inside `gbrain init`. Non-TTY initialization tentatively
applies its recommendation: `conservative` for a Haiku subagent or no detected
expansion-capable key, otherwise `tokenmax`. Existing valid selections are
preserved. This differs from retrieval's `balanced` fallback when no valid
`search.mode` is stored; the picker asks agents to confirm the choice with
their operator before continuing a real setup.

## Query instruction prefix

Instruction-style embedding models (Qwen3-Embedding, e5, BGE v1.5, nomic-embed)
expect a query instruction in front of each search query and none in front of
documents. GBrain sends no instruction unless you set one for the brain;
nothing is guessed from the model id at query time. `gbrain doctor` reports
`embedding_query_prefix` when the configured model belongs to one of those
families and no prefix is set, and prints the model card's value as a command
you can run as printed.

| Family | Documented value |
|---|---|
| Qwen3-Embedding | `Instruct: Given a web search query, retrieve relevant passages that answer the query` + newline + `Query:` |
| e5 | `query: ` |
| BGE v1.5 | `Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages: ` |
| nomic-embed | `search_query: ` |

**Set.** Quote the value so trailing spaces and newlines survive the shell;
a newline needs ANSI-C quoting:

```bash
gbrain config set embedding_query_prefix "query: "
gbrain config set embedding_query_prefix $'Instruct: Given a web search query, retrieve relevant passages that answer the query\nQuery:'
```

The prefix is stored in the brain's database config, so each brain (and each
mounted brain in one MCP server) uses its own. It applies to query embeddings
only: keyword search uses the original query, stored document vectors are not
re-embedded, and the query-cache key includes the prefix. It takes effect on
the next CLI or MCP query without restarting a running server.

**Verify.** `gbrain config get embedding_query_prefix --raw` prints the stored
bytes, and `gbrain doctor` stops reporting `embedding_query_prefix`.

**Unset.** `gbrain config unset embedding_query_prefix` restores bare query
embeddings on the next query.

nomic-embed also expects `search_document: ` in front of documents. GBrain does
not prefix documents, so on nomic the query prefix is a partial fix (#3783).

## Choosing a lookup verb (search vs query vs get)

Independent of which bundle is active, every individual lookup should use
the cheapest verb that answers the question.

```
on user_asks_about(topic):
    # Decision tree: pick the right lookup verb

    if know_exact_slug(topic):
        # Direct get -- instant, no search overhead
        result = gbrain get <slug>
        # e.g., "Tell me about Alice" -> gbrain get alice-example
        # Returns the FULL page -- compiled truth + timeline

    elif topic.is_exact_name or topic.is_keyword:
        # MODE 1: Cheap-hybrid search -- vector + keyword + RRF, NO LLM
        # expansion. Embeds the query when embeddings are configured; the
        # keyword arm still works day-one without them (keyword-only is
        # also available via the search.mcp_keyword_only opt-out).
        results = gbrain search "{name_or_keyword}"
        # e.g., "Find anything about Series A" -> gbrain search "Series A"
        # Returns CHUNKS, not full pages

        # IMPORTANT: search returns chunks
        # If the chunk confirms relevance, THEN load the full page:
        if chunk.confirms_relevance:
            full_page = gbrain get <slug_from_chunk>

    elif topic.is_semantic_question or topic.is_concept_or_landscape:
        # MODE 2: Full hybrid -- adds multi-query LLM expansion on top of
        # vector + keyword + RRF. Owns concept / landscape / "all-of-X"
        # questions: expansion recovers synonym- and outcome-phrased
        # matches a single embedding misses. Costs one LLM expansion call
        # per query -- worth it for these question shapes.
        results = gbrain query "{natural language question}"
        # e.g., "Who do I know at fintech companies?" -> gbrain query "fintech contacts"
        # e.g., "all the companies doing offshore wind" -> gbrain query "..."
        # Returns ranked chunks via vector + keyword + expansion + RRF

        # Same rule: chunks first, then get full page if needed
        if chunk.confirms_relevance:
            full_page = gbrain get <slug_from_chunk>

# Quick reference:
# | Mode        | Command              | Needs Embeddings | Speed   | Best For                                  |
# |-------------|----------------------|------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
# | Cheap-hybrid| gbrain search "term" | Uses if present  | Fastest | Known names, exact tokens                 |
# | Full hybrid | gbrain query "..."   | Yes              | Fast    | Concept / landscape / "all-of-X", synonyms |
# | Direct      | gbrain get <slug>    | No               | Instant | When you know the slug                    |

# Progression over time:
#   Day 1:  search (keyword arm works without embeddings)
#   After first embed: vector arm + full hybrid (query) unlocked
#   Once you know slugs: direct get for speed

# Precedence for conflicting information within a page:
#   1. User's direct statements (always wins)
#   2. Compiled truth sections (synthesized from evidence)
#   3. Timeline entries (raw signal, reverse chronological)
#   4. External sources (web search, APIs)
```

### Tricky Spots

1. **Search returns chunks, not full pages.** After `gbrain search` or `gbrain query`, you get excerpts. Always run `gbrain get <slug>` to load the full page when the chunk confirms relevance. Don't answer questions from chunks alone when the full context matters.
2. **Search works without embeddings.** On day one before any embedding run, `gbrain search` still works (the keyword arm carries it; the vector arm joins once embeddings exist). Don't tell the user "search isn't available yet" -- search is always available.
3. **Don't use full hybrid for known names.** `gbrain query "Alice Example"` wastes an LLM expansion call. Use `gbrain search "Alice Example"` or better yet `gbrain get alice-example` if you know the slug.
4. **Token budget awareness.** A full page via `gbrain get` can be large. Read the search chunks first to confirm relevance before pulling the full page. "Did anyone mention the Series A?" -- search results (chunks) are probably enough. "Tell me everything about Alice" -- get the full page.
5. **Full hybrid needs embeddings to have been run.** If `gbrain query` returns nothing but `gbrain search` finds results, the embeddings haven't been generated yet. Run the embedding pipeline first.
6. **A populated `gbrain search` result set is not proof you found everything.** Search runs without query expansion, so synonym- and outcome-phrased matches can be missed even when it returns plenty of hits. For "find every / all / the landscape of" questions, use `gbrain query`; for literal exhaustive enumeration ("list every page of type X"), use `list_pages` pagination. A nonzero count is not a completeness signal.

### How to Verify

1. Run `gbrain search "Alice"` -- confirm it returns chunks with matching text and slug references.
2. Run `gbrain query "who works at fintech companies"` -- confirm it returns semantically relevant results (not just keyword matches on "fintech").
3. Run `gbrain get alice-example` -- confirm it returns the full page with compiled truth and timeline.
4. Compare: search for the same entity using all three modes. Keyword should be fastest, hybrid should surface conceptual matches, direct should return the complete page.
5. After a search returns a chunk, run `gbrain get` on the slug from that chunk. Confirm the full page contains more context than the chunk alone.
6. Run `gbrain search modes` -- confirm the active mode bundle, any per-key overrides, and the `Reranker:` line (`enabled` with the key present, or `off`) are what you expect.
